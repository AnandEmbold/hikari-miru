=======================
Versions 1.0+ Changelog
=======================

These are all the changelogs for stable releases of hikari-miru (version 1.0.0 to present).

----

Version 1.0.0
=============

- Remove ``app`` parameter from ``View``

- Add ``miru.load()`` to load miru and pass ``app``. This replaces passing ``app`` to view, and should be called once on startup.

- Add ``Context`` and switch all item methods to use it in favour of ``Interaction``.

- Moved all short-hand methods from ``Interaction`` to ``Context``, renaming some of them. Please check the API reference for both.

- ``Interaction`` is now practically identical to ``hikari.ComponentInteraction`` with no added methods.

- Added documentation to the project

- Views are now assigned to messages, and if a new view is assigned to a message that already has one, the old one will be automatically stopped. This does not apply to unbound persistent views.
